## Main modules

### Collection

moonlan/snmp_collector.py owns SNMP interaction and converts vendor-specific responses into structured switch data. The collector uses one SNMP engine per process and per-switch locks. Different switches can be polled concurrently while overlapping operations against the same switch are serialized.

### Topology

moonlan/topology.py converts observations into links, hosts, pseudo-switches, bridges, groups, and placement decisions. Evidence has different strength: explicit LLDP agreement, validated direct FDB relationship, one-way/FDB inference, and approximate/trunk placement. The UI keeps that distinction visible.

### Monitoring

Counters, ping, STP, loop detection, and alarms run on separate cadences where possible. A slow topology poll should not unnecessarily block lightweight monitoring.

### Persistence

SQLite stores inventory, layout, alarms, and journal information. WAL mode is used for this workload so reads and writes can overlap safely.

### API

moonlan/server.py is the FastAPI boundary. It combines the latest topology state with fresh database fields when serving the UI.

The /api/health endpoint is intentionally cheap and does not require a successful SNMP scan. /api/status contains deeper operational state.

### Web UI

The web layer is static HTML/CSS/JavaScript. The browser refreshes API data and renders the topology with vis-network. Server-side content hashing gives UI assets versioned URLs while static responses remain revalidated.

## Performance boundaries

Keep different switch SNMP polls, independent ping targets, and independent counter polls parallel where their per-switch lock is free.

Keep operations against one switch serialized, database writes that preserve invariants ordered, and topology replacement as one logical state update.

Avoid creating a new SNMP engine for every scan, queueing indefinitely behind a slow switch, treating stale readings as fresh observations, rebuilding topology for an API request, or shelling out with user-controlled strings.

## Failure model

MoonLan prefers stale-but-labelled information to silently wrong information.

Examples:

- poll-budget expiry keeps the last complete reading but marks it as saved/stale;
- unsupported OID is not treated as zero;
- ambiguous links can remain visible with an explanation rather than being silently deleted;
- service/API failure keeps the last map and exposes the error state.

## Extension rule

When adding a feature, identify whether it is a new observation, a new inference, a persisted fact, an operator action, or presentation-only behavior. Keep those layers separate to reduce accidental coupling.
